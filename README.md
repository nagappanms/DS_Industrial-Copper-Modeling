# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing scripts clean and transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA scripts provide insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries. This step helps in understanding data distributions, relationships, and potential anomalies.

# Streamlit Application
The Streamlit application allows users to interactively visualize data and model predictions. It provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders to explore the results.
